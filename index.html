              See there how easy that is. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend.

              You need to have a very firm paint to do this. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. I'm a water fanatic. I love water. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall.

              Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. You can do it. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it.

              This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. In this world, everything can be happy. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? It's cold, but it's beautiful.

              I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. It looks so good, I might as well not stop.

              Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. We need a shadow side and a highlight side. Put it in, leave it alone. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. In your world you have total and absolute power. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will.

              You can get away with a lot. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. A fan brush can be your best friend. It's important to me that you're happy.

              It takes dark in order to show light. You can create anything that makes you happy. Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds.

              You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbersâ€”just to upset the critics. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. Anyone can paint. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature.

              This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. That's a son of a gun of a cloud.
